Now he gives Kiran a long String S which consists of lowercase English Alphabets and wants him to tell the minimum size of substring such that all the substrings of that size in S have at least K Consonants(Non-vowels) in them.
If none of the subArray size satisfy the above condition ,return -1.

First line of input contains a String S.
Second line of input contains an Integer K.


Constraints

Sample TestCase 1
Input
ritikisagoodboy
4
Output
9
Explanation
All substrings of length 9 have greater or equal to 4 non-vowels in them and this is the minimum size that we can have.
In substring of size 8 .. the substring ''ikisagoo'' has only 3 non-vowels therefore it violates the condition.
